      <p class="text-muted">KidzMondo is an indoor theme park following the conceptual approach of educational entertainment or playful learning. It is an ideal forum where social rules and values are promoted and ingrained in children to prepare them to behave as good adult citizens would in real life.

        KidzMondo aims to complement local school curricula and seeks to teach children basic citizenship values and rules, enlightening them about the society they live in today.
        
        It is an established fact that children learn best through play and experiencing real hands on activities. The range of playful activities inside KidzMondo is exclusively created and constructed to help, encourage and advance physical growth while stimulating intellectual growth. The KidzMondo Educational Curriculum improves the development of skills and attitudes all the while motivating creative thinking and enhancing self-esteem and self-confidence levels.
        
        Children can choose between 120+ different professions which are practiced in replica of the most representative establishments in an actual city; an airport, a bank, factories, a theater, shops, a police station, a fire department, a digital media office, a hotel, a TV studio, a radio station, a gas station, a race track and many more...
        
        KidzMondo provides children with a relevant and tangible learning experience, appealing to the need to address and encourage interest. Children will be exposed to age-appropriate activities in a dynamic and safe surrounding. They will be attracted to go through the different establishments, while providing them with a mental and physical voyage of investigation, exploration, and adults' role play.</p>

      <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">i had visited it in 2022</h5>
      <p class="text-muted">As early as 1881, Mr. Blanford, then Meteorological Reporter to the Government of India, recommended "the improvement of the work of solar observations in order to obtain accurate measures of the sun’s heating power at the earth’s surface and its periodic variations".[2] In May 1882, the government astronomer at Madras, Norman Robert Pogson, proposed the need for photography and spectrography of the sun and the stars using a twenty-inch telescope, which could be at a hill station in South India.

        On 20 July 1893 following a famine in Madras Presidency, which underscored the need for a study of the sun to better understand monsoon patterns, a meeting of the U.K. Secretary of State, Indian Observatories Committee, chaired by Lord Kelvin, decided to establish a solar physics observatory at Kodaikanal, based on its southern, dust free, high altitude location. Michie Smith was selected to be superintendent. Starting in 1895 there was a rapid transfer of work and equipment from the Madras Observatory to Kodaikanal and the observatory was founded on 1 April 1899.
        
        The first observations were commenced at Kodaikanal in 1901.[3]

        A 12 m solar tower with modern spectrograph was established in 1960 by Amil Kumar Das and used to perform some of the first ever helioseismology investigations. Measurements of vector magnetic fields were initiated during the 1960s.
        
        In 1977, many of the astronomers from Kodaikanal shifted to Bangalore and established the Indian Institute of Astrophysics.[9]</p>

        <p>In the 29th century, Earth has become a garbage-strewn wasteland due to rampant consumerism and corporate greed; seven centuries earlier, the megacorporation Buy-n-Large (BnL) evacuated humanity to space on giant starliners. Of all the trash compacting robots left by BnL to clean up, only one robot remains operational, Waste Allocation Load-Lifter: Earth-Class (WALL-E). It learned to survive by using salvaged parts from other broken-down robots to repair itself, and after centuries of life experience has developed sentience, including a sense of curiosity about artifacts from human civilization.

          One day, WALL-E's routine of compressing trash and collecting interesting objects is disrupted by the arrival of an unmanned probe carrying an egg-shaped robot named Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator (EVE), who has been sent to scan the planet for signs of sustainable life. WALL-E is smitten by the sleek, otherworldly robot, and the two begin to connect, until EVE goes into standby when WALL-E shows her his most recent find; a living seedling. Sometime later, the probe returns to collect EVE and the plant, and, with WALL-E clinging on, returns to its mothership, the starliner Axiom.
          
          In the centuries since the Axiom left Earth, its passengers have degenerated into corpulence due to laziness and microgravity, their every whim catered to by machinery. The captain, B. McCrea, is used to sitting back while his robot steering wheel AUTO pilots the ship. McCrea is unprepared to receive the positive probe response, but learns via a pre-recorded message from BnL that placing the plant in the ship's Holo-Detector will trigger a hyperjump back to Earth so humanity can begin recolonization. When McCrea inspects EVE's storage compartment, however, the plant is missing, and EVE blames WALL-E for its disappearance.
          
          EVE is deemed faulty and taken to Diagnostics. Mistaking the process for torture, WALL-E intervenes and inadvertently releases a group of malfunctioning reject-bots, causing him and EVE to be designated as rogues. Angrily, EVE tries to send WALL-E home in an escape pod, but before she can do so, they witness AUTO's henchmen GO-4 stowing the plant in a pod set to self-destruct, revealing that WALL-E did not steal the plant. WALL-E attempts to retrieve it, but is launched into space in the pod. EVE uses an emergency exit to chase after WALL-E, and witnesses the pod explode, although both he and the plant survive unscathed. He and EVE reconcile, celebrating with a dance in space around the Axiom.
          
          EVE brings the plant back to McCrea, who has been watching her recordings of Earth and concludes that they can and must save it. However, AUTO refuses, explaining that he has been programmed with the secret directive A113, issued after BnL declared in 2110 that the planet could not be saved, which ordered him to take control of the ship and never return to Earth, and reveals that he ordered GO-4 to get rid of the plant. When McCrea countermands the directive, AUTO and GO-4 mutiny, electrocuting WALL-E's circuit-board, putting EVE into standby, throwing them both down the garbage chute, and locking McCrea in his quarters. EVE and WALL-E are nearly ejected into space along with the ship's refuse, but cleaner robot Microbe-Obliterator (M-O), who had been following WALL-E's dirt trail across the ship, saves the two by alerting the WALL-A bots and prompting them to abort the ejection. As humans and robots help in securing the plant, WALL-E, EVE, M-O and the reject-bots head to the Holo-Detector, while McCrea and AUTO fight for control of the ship. WALL-E sacrifices himself by allowing himself to be crushed by the Holo-Detector, jamming it open and buying EVE time to successfully insert the plant, which initiates the hyperjump. McCrea eventually overpowers and deactivates AUTO by switching him to Manual Mode.
          
          Arriving back on Earth, EVE repairs WALL-E, but finds that his memory and personality have been erased. Sadly, EVE gives WALL-E a goodbye "kiss", which restores him back to his normal self. WALL-E and EVE reunite with M-O and the reject-bots as the inhabitants of the Axiom take their first steps on Earth. During the credits, humans and robots turn the ravaged planet back into a paradise, and the plant is shown to have grown into a mighty tree, which EVE and WALL-E rest beneath.</p>
